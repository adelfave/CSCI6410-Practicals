## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(datasauRus)
```

```{r}
dino_data<-datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=dino_data,mapping=aes(x=x,y=y))+geom_point()
```
Calculate the summary statistic (i.e., correlation coefficient) between x and y.
```{r}
dino_data %>% 
  summarize(r=cor(x,y))
```
3. Plot y vs. x for the "star" dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r in "dino"?
```{r}
star_data<-datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset=="star")
```

Plot x and y of star dataset
```{r}
ggplot(data=star_data,mapping=aes(x=x,y=y))+
  geom_point()
```
Calculate correlation coefficient of x and y from star dataset.
```{r}
star_data %>%
  summarize(r=cor(x,y))
```
Comparing both correlation coefficients, we see that both datasets have a quite low negative correlation coefficient between their respective x and y variables. However, the dino dataset has a bit of a minutely higher correlation compared to the star dataset.

4. Plot y vs. x for the "circle" dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?

A. Filter out our data so that we only are looking at the "circle" dataset.
```{r}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")
```

B. Plot visualization of x and y of "circle" dataset.
```{r}
ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
C. Calculate correlation coefficient (r) between x and y and compare it to the dino dataset.
```{r}
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r=cor(x,y))
```
```{r}
dino_data %>% 
  summarize(r=cor(x,y))
```
Both of these correlation coefficients are quite low and both show a negative relationship. However, the circle dataset has a slightly higher correlation between x and y than the dino dataset does.

5. Plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.
```{r}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen,aes(x=x,y=y,color=dataset))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~dataset,ncol=3)+
  theme(legend.position="none")
```
Now we will also use the group_by function to generate all of the correlation coefficients for these plots.
```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
             summarize(r=cor(x,y))
```
